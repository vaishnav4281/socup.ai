Integration test for forensic_examiner with realistic incident scenario.

This tests the full flow:
1. Parse field documentation
2. Extract search keywords
3. Build queries (without IP/port confusion)
4. Generate timeline narrative

### Timeline
- **2026-01-10 08:30:45 UTC**: First connection attempt from Iran (IP 1.1.1.100) to 192.168.0.16:1194
- **2026-01-15 14:22:10 UTC**: Second connection attempt, 5 days later
- **2026-01-20 09:15:30 UTC**: Third connection attempt, 5 days later

### Pattern Analysis
- **Frequency**: 3 connection attempts over 10 days (recurring every 5 days)
- **Pattern Type**: Regular/Periodic - indicates automated bot or scheduled scanning
- **Source**: Single Iranian IP (1.1.1.100) with incremental source port numbers
- **Destination**: Consistent target (192.168.0.16:1194 - likely VPN service)
- **Protocol**: All TCP, indicating connection attempts

### Risk Assessment
- This is likely **automated reconnaissance** (bot-like behavior)
- The periodic 5-day interval suggests cron job or periodic scanner
- The consistent target and port indicate targeted probing, not random scanning
- **Threat Level**: MEDIUM - Persistent reconnaissance activity from hostile nation

### Recommendations
1. Block the IP 1.1.1.100 at firewall
2. Implement rate limiting on VPN port 1194
3. Monitor for successful connections from this IP
4. Alert on further attempts from Iran"""
