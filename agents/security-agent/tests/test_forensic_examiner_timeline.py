tests/test_forensic_examiner_timeline.py

Comprehensive test for forensic_examiner timeline functionality.

Tests that forensic_examiner:
1. Properly parses field types to avoid IP/port confusion
2. Returns rich timeline data with dates and pattern analysis
3. Builds comprehensive forensic reports with proper structure
