"""
tests/test_threat_analyst_context_enrichment.py

Tests that verify supervisor passes previous results to threat_analyst
so it can analyze SPECIFIC entities rather than generic questions.

This fixes the bug where:
- opensearch_querier found 2 Iran IPs
- threat_analyst was called but didn't know which IPs to analyze
- Result: threat_analyst returned generic reputation info instead of analyzing the discovered IPs
